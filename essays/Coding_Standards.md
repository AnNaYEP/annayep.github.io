summary: "Reflecting on Coding standards so far."

# Personal Reflection
I personally agree that coding standards help one learn a language. This is because it establishes rules that help with collaboration and with recieving assistance when it comes to code reviews. I think back on my internship experience where I worked with APIs. It was important to follow standards so that code could be peer-reviewed by my mentors. 

# ESLint and VSCode impressions
At first, ESLint was difficult, as I ran into many errors. I still do, but it took me a bit to troubleshoot what was wrong. One error I encountered was VSCode renaming my saved files during my assignments. It would delete the "." before files, which was needed for ESLint to recognize the configuration files in my assignments. VSCode on the other hand was easy to get a hang of, as it was and still is what is normally used since I started programming back in High School.

# Final Opinion
I personally dislike all the dependancies needed to get a programming to work. A bit example is node.js, as all the packages are still confusing for me to navigate whenever I run into errors. I do think that adds to the beauty of programming, however. This is because we are free to implement and fix isssues in any way we can. The flexability of software development is what keeps me pursuing it as my career. I originally wanted to do IT related work like cybersecurity, but all the proprietary software/hardware, along with the cost of equipment for a home lab pushed me away from that career, and thrusted me into Software Engineering. It isn't restricted to a company's hardware or software, and there is huge advocacy for Open Source Software, where anyone can contribute. I find it more social and friendly, and if not for that, I would be pursuing a different career that has a hard focus on flexible problem solving.
