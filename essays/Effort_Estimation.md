# On Effort Estimations
I mainly made my estimates based on the amount of days I focused on. I would either work 4 or 8 hour sessions, and looking at my commit history along with time I worked on the project during meetings.
Personally, while my estimations may be off, estimating in advance helped with alloting time to work on issues, even though I would always go over it due to trying to fix related issues with my computers, node packages, local development, or all three at once. 

# The Usefulness of Tracking Time
I found it useful and I saw how it helped my other team members prioritize and decide on issues to work on.
How did you track your actual effort (tools, method)? How accurate do you believe your tracking was? 
The method I used was to count the days I worked on the issue + some extra time as I found myself working past the time alloted.

# A Reflection on Time Estimation
One thing I would change is to add padding between issues. By padding, I mean adding an expected time, and a realistic time added by other members to gauge how much it might take if we happen to go over the expected time to finish a task. 

# AI Tools
For each AI tool used, provide: I didn't use AI tools to personally estimate time or to track effort. The reason being is that all the information I needed to estimate was already available. This includes meeting times and commits.
