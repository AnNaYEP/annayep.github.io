# Personal Opinions
I personally think Typescript is neat, bringing the ability of object oriented programming to a higher level language. It felt familiar because of what I learned back in 211 with Java programming. Although I have used typescript in the past for an Internship, I never fully explored its capabilities. This is because I was mostly learning Typescript APIs to write jest tests. While interfaces and inheritance were used, I only had to understand it and not utilize it when writing programs. 

# Software Engineering Perspective
From a Software Engineering perspective, I think it is a great language. It builds off of a langauge many are required to learn when taking an intro class to programming, which usually revolves around webpages and making them interactive (Javascript). I also like how it addresses some downsides of Javascript, with type errors being a big focus. From personal experience too, I think Typescript is sort of what Arduino is to embedded electronics as Typescript is to software development While it may not be the most optimized for the job, it gets the job done and done quick. 

# On Athletic Software Engineering
I find value in the practice WODs, as it feels like a pop quiz on what we are learning at the moment. It is a little new to me, but the time ranges also help give a gauge of how much time I may need to spend on the current topic we are learning. The only downside to me personally is that it does get stressful, but I feel with more practice, it will go on to be more enjoyable. While I do think AI usage being allowed is cool, a part of me wonders if there is any value to me personnally to use it. This is because it feels like I am passing the work onto someone else, but I also see the value in using it in a learning environment, so I am overall neutral to it.
