# Overview
_The Problem:_ Students need money, and also need to get rid of things, especially for students that dorm on campus.
_The Solution:_ A way for students to make money, and less trash for the environment and dorms. Helps relieve stress because dorms have to move out during finals week.

# Proposers
Darilyn Evangelista, Andrew Narciso

# Approach
The goal of this site is to help students earn money and get rid of items they no longer need. This is for everyone, but it is especially helpful towards those who dorm and have to leave during finals week. It also helps reduce waste from going into landfills. 

There are three roles: Buyers, who can view potential sales; Sellers, who can list and sell their own items; and Admins, who can manage and moderate the users and website.

# Mockup page ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:

* Landing page
* User home page
* Admin home page (can control listings & support users)
* User profile page / user reviews page
* Shop Listing page
* Add Listing page
* Support Page 

# Use case ideas
* Add Listing page: Dorm students moving out during finals can sell unneeded furniture by adding their item as a listing.
* Shop Listing page: A student looking for cheaper and more accessible materials can easily find their desired item by searching and filtering what they want.
* Admin Home Page: Admins can remove any scammers/inappropriate items by looking through the database.

# Beyond the basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* Seller rating system
* Internal messaging system for communication
* Browse listings by price, recency, tag/category
* Email notification integration when someone is interested
